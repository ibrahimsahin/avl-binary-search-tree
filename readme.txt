Develop  a  program  that  uses  AVL  Tree
mentioned above. AVL Tree holds positive integer values. Your program must handle 
these commands:
insert  <number>:  With  this  command,  you  must  insert  the  number  to  the  AVL 
Tree.  If AVL Tree has a node with <number>, you will do nothing. If the balance 
of AVL Tree changes, you will balance the tree.
delete <number>:  With  this  command,  you  must  delete  the  node  whose  value  is 
<number> from the AVL Tree. If AVL Tree hasnâ€™t a node with <number>, you will do 
nothing. If the balance of AVL Tree changes, you will balance the tree.
show preorder: With this command, you must show the AVL Tree with preorder.
show postorder: With this command, you must show the AVL Tree with postorder.
show inorder: With this command, you must show the AVL Tree with inorder.
